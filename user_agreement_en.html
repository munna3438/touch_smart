        For any incidental, special, punitive or indirect damage arising from or
        in connection with your use of the Agreement, or the use of or inability
        to use TAS Smart Services, including loss of profit, data loss, service
        interruption, computer damage, system failure or replacement service
        charges, TAS Smart, its suppliers or licensors, and any other parties
        participating in the creation, production or delivery of TAS
        Smart Services shall not be held liable, whether based on warranty,
        contract, tort (including negligence), product liability or other legal
        theories, and whether TAS Smart has ever been notified of the
        possibility of damage or not, even if the limited remedy provisions
        contained herein are deemed to have failed to achieve their necessary
        purpose.
      </p>
      <p>
        In no event shall the total liability of TAS Smart arising from or in
        connection with the Agreement, or your use of or inability to use TAS
        Smart Services exceed the amount paid to TAS Smart by you for using TAS
        Smart Services. The above-mentioned damage exclusion and limitation
        provisions are the fundamental basis for TAS Smart to make a deal with
        you.
      </p>
      <p>
        In some jurisdictions, no exclusion or limitation of liability for
        indirect or incidental damage is allowed, so the above limitations may
        not apply to you.
      </p>
      <h2>18. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution</h2>
      <p>
        The validity and interpretation of the Agreement shall be governed by
        the laws of the Mainland of the People's Republic of China. If there are
        no applicable laws or regulations, the international commercial
        practices and/or general commercial practices shall apply. The Agreement
        has been signed in Longgang District, Shenzhen Municipality, Guangdong
        Province, China.
      </p>
      <p>
        Both the user and TAS Smart agree that all disputes arising from the
        Agreement shall be settled through negotiation. If the negotiation
        fails, either party may submit such dispute to Shenzhen Court of
        International Arbitration for arbitration.
      </p>
      <h2>19. General Provisions</h2>
      <p>
        We will notify you before making major amendments to the Agreement and
        give you the opportunity to view the revised terms. You can then decide
        whether to continue using TAS Smart Services or not. By continuing to
        use TAS Smart Services after the revision is released, you shall be
        deemed to have accepted the revised agreement.
      </p>
      <p>
        If any provision of the Agreement is declared to be invalid or
        unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction for any reason, such
        provision shall be enforced to the maximum extent permitted, and the
        remaining provisions of the Agreement shall remain in full effect.
      </p>
      <p>
        Any notifications or other communications provided by TAS Smart under
        the Agreement, including the notifications or communications regarding
        amendments to the Agreement, shall: (1) be delivered by email; or (2) be
        released on TAS Smart. Any notification delivered by email shall be
        deemed served on the date of receipt of the email.
      </p>
      <p>
        TAS Smart's failure to exercise any rights or provisions under the
        Agreement shall not be deemed a waiver of such rights or provisions. No
        waiver of such rights or provisions shall be considered effective unless
        made in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of TAS
        Smart. Unless otherwise expressly provided in this Section, either
        party's exercise of its any remedy under the Agreement shall not affect
        its other remedies under the Agreement or elsewhere.
      </p>
      <h2>20. Applicability of Additional Provisions</h2>
      <p>
        Additional provisions may apply to specific products or services. If

        provisions, the additional provisions shall prevail.
