      <h2>1. Information Collected</h2>
      <p>
        We may collect the following kinds of information when you use our
        products and services.
      </p>
      <h3>Account Information:</h3>
      <p>
        Creating an account on our application collects "required information"
        such as country or region, email address, password, date of birth,
        gender, height, weight, and "optional information" such as your
        nickname, weight goal, step goal, and profile picture. The information
        collected will be used as part of the health data algorithm. For
        example, the heart rate algorithm will generate relevant and more
        accurate health data based on your age, height, and weight. Your
        personal information will be anonymized and encrypted.
      </p>
      <h3>Exercise & Health-related Information:</h3>
      <p>
        steps, distance, speed, exercise time, calories, sleep time, heart rate,
        stress, oxygen saturation, walking time, exercise intensity, exercise
        type, ambient sound level, skin temperature, detailed exercise history
        for each exercise type, and medals (virtual medals awarded based on your
        exercise), etc. The exercise data collected will be used to provide you
        with personalized exercise feedback (e.g., evaluation of the
        effectiveness of your exercise) and to provide you with better health
        management services (e.g., developing good sleep habits). This type of
        data is encrypted and will not be collected if you opt out of the
        feature. Cloud data synchronization can be turned off in TAS Smart under
        "Data Analysis and Security".
      </p>
      <h3>Location Information:</h3>
      <p>
         Your phone's location information may be used for certain
        location-based services. For example, it will be called up when you are
        in outdoor sports mode, checking the weather, or selecting your area.
        Such information collection will be disabled in the event you do not
        permit us to access your phone's GPS function.
      </p>
      <h3>Device MAC and APP Information:</h3>
      <p>
        your device and application information, such as user configuration
        data, device MAC address, device version number, serial number, firmware
        version, language, APP version, phone system version, device
        configuration, IP address, network type, device identification, etc.,
        may be collected when you use our devices and applications. Only the
        information of the device that has been connected to our services will
        be obtained: when the APP is connected to the device, the information
        will be stored locally on the phone and uploaded to the server. This
        kind of information will be used for upgrade services such as updating
        the device firmware version, updating the APP version, updating the
        watch face version, updating the device language, or for locating and
        analyzing the relevant application or device firmware issues.
      </p>
      <h3>Service Information:</h3>
      <p>
        Certain features of TAS Smart devices and applications may access your
        personal information (e.g., reminder setting or exercise record). For
        example, the "Menstrual Cycle Reminder" feature may collect your
        menstrual cycle and ovulation data, etc.; the "Call Reminder” feature
        may access (but not store) your call status and contacts; the "Message
        Notification" feature may access (temporarily store) the notification
        status of third party applications; the "Music Control" feature may
        access (but not store) the information such as song playback and song
        status; and the "Alarm Clock" feature may use your phone's built-in
        clock function.
      </p>
      <h3>Feedback Information: </h3>
      <p>
         If you have any questions or suggestions, please give feedback through
        "My>Question and Suggestion", where you can provide your contact
        information at your discretion. Your feedback helps us better understand
        the problem you are experiencing. During the feedback process, if you
        agree, we may access your phone's camera, photo album, etc., so that you
        can upload pictures of the issue and help us quickly locate it.
      </p>
      <h3>Log Information: </h3>
      <p>
        We may collect usage data when you use our devices or applications,
        which may include, for example, account creation or login information,
        account-device pairing information, device reboot information, network
        usage information, as well as information on system errors, crashes,
        reboots, and upgrades. Your latest log information within 7 days will be
        automatically stored locally on your phone while earlier log information
        will be automatically deleted. Uploading logs can help us resolve your
        issue at a faster rate. However, we do not gather such information
        unless you opt to upload your logs to our server through "My>Question
        and Suggestion". QUERY_ALL_PACKAGES permission:If you use the "Message
        Notification" and "Share" functions, you need to query the installed
        application list information. By default, the Android system platform
        only detects some filtered installed applications. You need to call the
        QUERY_ALL_PACKAGES permission to get the list of installed applications
        on the device. The obtained app list information is only stored locally
        on your phone and will not be uploaded to our server.
      </p>
      <h3>Guest Information: </h3>

        information. Android ID：If you use the Android system and use the app
        in the guest state,we will obtain your Android ID through the public API
        of the Android system,which will be used as a unique identifier for your
        use of the app.If the app is in the background,it will also be read when
        it needs to get the Android ID. Paid services: After logging in to your
        TAS Smart account, you can buy some services to obtain the corresponding
        rights and interests, virtual goods or assets. We will collect your
        payment records, membership status and rights, so that you can check
        them at any time. Your TAS Smart account information will be used to
        verify your identity, create and store your orders and collect your
        payment information. Meanwhile, it will be used to grant you the
        corresponding rights, virtual goods or assets, or share the payment
        status with third parties. Your virtual assets are sensitive data. We
        will take appropriate protective measures to ensure the accuracy and
        security of your asset data.
      </p>
      <h3>Other Information: </h3>

        of device reboots, error codes of hardware problems that cause device
        reboots, logs of Bluetooth connectivity of applications, device and
        application usage of anonymized users (opt-in), and more. The purpose is

        (com.tencent.bugly) has been integrated for quick fixing of TAS
        Smart issues. These logs only contain information about the parameters
        of the user's phone and do not involve personal information.
